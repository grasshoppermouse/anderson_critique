Meagan Biesele (personal communication) knew of one young woman in the !Gon!a area who used to hunt small game…They do collect tortoises, lizards, and snakes (the last as large as a 3-meter-long python), and they accurately and energetically kill poisonous snakes, spiders, and scorpions if they find them in the camp or on the path, but basically they leave hunting to the men.\" (Lee 1979:235)\n“Current literature speaks of hunting as a collective effort and of the participation of women as beaters and as transporters of game among the San, the hunters and gatherers of Kalahari (Tanaka, 1980: p. 165).” Singh (2001:114)","\"Women do not hunt.

Women never participate in a !Kung hunt.” (Marshall 1976:96-97) as cited in Brightman (1996:704)\n“The Dobe Ju/'hoansi pose the interesting case of women who own arrows and loan them to men but, predictably, do not hunt with them” (Lee 1979:24) as cited in Brightman (1996:705)\n“Seemingly the commonest situation exists among the Dobe Ju/'hoansi, where women exhibited no desire to hunt and men did not resent their non-participation (Lee 1979:235).” Brightman (1996:716)","““Big hunts,” or long expeditions targeting large mammals, have been described as a male activity, although their success is dependent on women’s collective and ritual power” Lewis (2002) as cited in Reyes-García et al. (2020: 207)\n“...medium-sized species predominated in Baka women’s harvests, in terms of both number of animals killed (65.9%) and yields (50%).” Reyes-García et al. (2020: 212)\n“...women killed fewer animals than men (Tsimane’ and Baka women killed 8.3% and 17.5% of the animals reported).” Reyes-García et al. (2020: 212)","\"...men hunted with different methods, but women performed only net hunting…” Kitanishi 1995:89)\n“Spear hunting by women was once observed in Period 6. This hunt was accidental. It took place when the men had gone spear hunting for several days (njango). A women encountered a bush pig near the camp, and the women at the camp chased it with spears\" (Kitanishi 1995:89)\n“Kitanishi reports that Aka \"women also handle the nets and beat the bush, when there are not enough adult and adolescent men. Occasionally, women lead net-hunting when no adult man participates in the hunt\" (1995:81).” (Kitanishi 1995:81 as cited by Noss &amp; Hewlett 2001: 1027)","“Net hunting (lubala) is a group activity, in which both men and women participate.” Terashima (1980:239)\n“When women are ready at their positions, they start driving animals.” Terashima (1980:240)\n“Nevertheless, the low participation ratio of women suggests that women are unwilling to hunt, an attitude which is more easily understood when it is known that female participation in hunting is an unusual event which began rather recently (see below). “ Terashima (1980:243)","“Some individual Agta and Efe women archers are described (Estioko-Griffin 1985:23-24; Bailey and Aunger 1989: 278; Terashima 1983), although these latter groups hunt in regional divisions of labor to produce meat for external trade.” Estioko-Griffin (1985:23-24); Bailey and Aunger (1989: 278); Terashima (1983) as cited by Brightman (1996: 701)\n“Silverblatt's remarks, cited above, appear in the same volume with an article affirming that maternal immobilization thesis precludes big-game hunting by Efe women” Peacock (1991: 355) as cited by Brightman (1996: 710)\n“When women participate in hunts (occasionally among the Efe and routinely among net hunters), they always act as \"beaters,\" so that they are behind rather than in front of fleeing animals and are not in the immediate vicinity of weapon use.” Peacock (1991: 355)","“The principal hunting method in the Tetri region is net hunting in which both men and women participate.” Ichikawa (1987: 101)\n“Given that meat is more highly valued than field labor in these regions of the Ituri, it is not surprising that forager women invest their energy in hunting in order to produce a tradable surplus of meat. Although this effectively explains why net- hunter women are involved in hunting for much of the year, it still does not explain why bows and arrows were abandoned and nets adopted.” Wilkie and Curran (1991: 682)\n“Mbuti women who are \"likely to be off on the hunt, or on the trail somewhere when birth takes place\" (Turnbull 1965:129)” Turnbull (1965:129) as cited by Brightman (1996:702)\n“The part women played in the hunt was symbolic and ritual rather than practical.” Terashima (1983:76)\n“One difference between begbe and musilo is as follows: while in musilo women do only a symbolic work, in begbe they are said to do practical work just like in net hunting. Harako and Turnbull \" write: \" ... [in begbe] women and children attend as beaters, taking the same formation as in net hunting\" (Harako, 1976: 54)[56]” Harako, 1976: 54 as cited by Terashima (1983:79)","“The Tswa hunt almost exclusively with nets, catching primarily duiker, but also genet, mongoose, and other small and middle-sized mammals.” Bailey &amp; Aunger (1989: 275)\n“...women frequently do not participate in hunts. Tswa women do hunt when the Tswa are camped in the forest more than an hour from Budu villages.” Bailey &amp; Aunger (1989: 290)","No evidence","“... Hadza women will kill game (usually small animals) when they have the chance...” (Marlowe, 2010:269)\n“Women, on rare occasions, kill some small animals, and they often butcher smaller animals and roast or boil the meat.” (Marlowe, 2010:130)\n“There are large mixed-sex foraging parties during berry season and during the time that the weaver bird, the redbilled quelea (Quelea quelea), has its mass reproduction. For about two weeks before the chicks are fledged, the Hadza pull down the nests, using a long branch to reach those higher up, and gather the chicks by the thousands.” (Marlowe, 2010:130)","“Net hunting requires not only the participation of men, women, and forest animals, but also and above all “spirits” (minkugi) that protect the forest and the Bakola and provide them with game.” (Ngima Mawoung, 2006:57)\n“..married women also carry the spears of their husbands whenever they enter into the forest by themselves to gather wild food, or to hunt small animals like Gambian rats. Spear hunting is practiced individually, even on the spot when they encounter with a target.” (Ngima Mawoung, 2006:53)\n“It is common that two or three dogs are kept in a household, and they are used indiscriminately by men, women and children of the household. Dogs are particularly effective for tracing a wild animal in the forest, holding a larger animal at bay while the hunter aims at spearing it (bushpigs were once hunted in this way), or capturing smaller animals like porcupines and forest rats by themselves.” (Ngima Mawoung, 2006:53)","“Bofi women and children fulfill a wide range of tasks on the net-hunt such as transporting, setting up, and taking down nets, acting as beaters, dispatching captured prey, and butchering and transporting carcasses back to residential sites.” Lupo &amp; Schmitt (2002: 155)\n“Although we did not observe this activity during the 1999/2000 field season, single Bofi women or groups of related women procure giant pouched rats unaided by men.” Lupo &amp; Schmitt (2002: 155)","“Ainu women were occasionally observed to hunt large game using rope and dogs, (Watanabe, 1968) and R. Gould (personal communication) observed women hunting with dogs among Western Australian Desert Aborigines.” Watanabe (1968:74) as cited in Goodman et al. (1985:1201)\n“Ainu women hunted deer with clubs, ropes, and dogs” Brightman (1996:705) likely citing Watanabe (1968:74)","“Hunting is done mainly by men, either alone or in small groups.” Endicott (1984:35)\n“Bamboo rats (Rhizomys sumatrensis), which reach six pounds in weight, are a frequent source of meat. They live beneath clumps of bamboo and are obtained with digging sticks, by women as well as by men.” Endicott (1984:35)","“It is not allowed for women to hunt.” Van der Sluys (1996:70)","No mention of hunting in Panter-Brick (1989)","“Women collect (wild growing) tubers (mostly Dioscorea), roots of different rattan varieties, fruits and small animals as well as herbs and medicine.” (Lukas 2004:10)\nGoodman et al. (1985) and Brightman (1996) have no mention of the Maniq.","“More recently, Estioko-Griffin and Griffin (1975, 1981) studying the Agta of northeastern Luzon, and Cagayan provinces in the Philippines, have recorded extensive wild pig and deer hunting on the part of Agta women.” (Goodman, 1985: 1201)","“In 1952, Fox reported skillful women bow and arrow hunters among the Pinatubo Negritos of the Zambales mountains of western Luzon.” (Goodman, 1985: 1201)","No evidence","In Table 1, the authors reference Hewlett (1996), which has only one reference to the Ganij in a paragraph about breastfeeding. No mention of women’s hunting found. In Table S1 Biesele (1993) is referenced which does not contain explicit mention of the Ganij.","Women said to be involved in hunting ‘game mammals’ in Table 1 (Hyndman 1984, p. 294)\n“Frogs, fish, lizards, snakes and tadpoles (Table 3) are collected by women and children.” (Hyndman 1984, p. 297)","“Batak women hunted cane rats with digging sticks.” (Brightman 1996, p. 705)","“...women of the tribe also did a large part of the hunting and catching of small game” (Mountford &amp; Harvey 1941, p. 155)","“...women assisted in kangaroo hunts, although they rarely captured them.” (Devitt, 1989:178)\n“Lizards were the animals most frequently taken by women. Of these, the goanna and perenti were preferred for both their meat and the fat they carried in good season”(Devitt, 1989:191)\n“...yet echidna were regularly hunted.” (Devitt, 1989:197)","No evidence","“In the most advantageous conditions, numerous fish were said to be left stranded on the floor of the trap when the water had completely run out. They were easily collected by hand (by men or women) or with a pronged fishing spear (by men), and carried ashore in bark containers or small hand-nets (figure 4.6). Dugong and turtle could be stranded in the same way but this was more likely during the biggest tides when the tops of the walls were covered with a substantial height of water” (Memmott et al. 2008, p. 56).","“According to Smith (1997:85) there are significant gender based differences in Karajarri customary fishing practise. Typically men target larger fish, while women focus on marine foraging and catching smaller fish” (Willing 2014:20).\n“Women especially continue to collect shellfish and crabs” (Willing 2014:20).\n“While some women and girls use these fishing spears, they are more commonly made and owned by men and teenage boys” (Willing 2014:22).","Not explicitly noted that women were participating in the hunting.","“In the most advantageous conditions, numerous fish were said to be left stranded on the floor of the trap when the water had completely run out.

This activity was very localized and very spasmodic, occurring only when and where conditions were right and somebody felt sufficiently energetic to organize it.” Hart et al.

<strong>Anderson et al.&nbsp;(2023) codes</strong>
<p><em>Society</em>: From Anderson et al.&nbsp;(2023)</p>
<p><em>Prey size</em>: From Anderson et al.&nbsp;(2023). Women hunt small, medium, or large game, or do not hunt.</p>
<strong>Our recoding</strong>
<p><em>Information from references</em>: Within the source ethnographies used by Anderson et al (2023), we selected text fragments that appeared to us the most relevant for coding the presence of women’s hunting, the frequency of hunting, and the size of prey hunted. While other sources contained relevant information about women’s hunting in these societies that was not consulted by Anderson et al.&nbsp;(2023), we confined our re-analysis to <em>only</em> the ethnographic sources - and sources used therein - used by Anderson et al.&nbsp;(2023). For a case to count as positive evidence for women’s hunting in our re-coding, it must involve ‘active’ participation by women (not only spiritual or ritual purposes).</p>
<p><em>Species &amp; body size</em>: Refers to prey specifically hunted by women. When prey pursued not specifically referred to, all potential prey listed. Species names taken from source ethnography; various online sources used to find average body weights. Most paragraphs contained information about prey species pursued. When this was not the case and thus no information about body size was available, we sourced potential prey species from online or ethnographic sources. These sources are listed. In cases where women are clearly not hunting based on the evidence, prey species not listed.</p>
<p><em>Hunt small-medium game (&lt;45kg)</em>, <em>Hunt large game (≥45kg)</em>: For these columns, we assessed the frequency of hunting. In cases where the body size of prey straddles the 45 kg cutoff, both columns were coded. When conflicting information is present between or within paragraphs (see the case of the !Kung, in which it is said ‘women do not hunt’, but in the same paragraph it is stated that they participate as beaters), we consider the concrete statements to overrule the general statement, thus favoring positive coding of women’s hunting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Frequently: Participation in hunting with some kind of regularity, including seasonal behavior. Example phrases include ‘frequently’, ‘always’, ‘common’, ‘often’, or similar.</li>
<li>Sometimes: Participation in hunting occurs less often than frequently but more often than rarely. Example phrases include ‘occasionally’, ‘sometimes’, or similar. When cases do not give any indication of frequency but state ‘women hunt’ or the statement involves the word ‘do’, we coded this as ‘frequently’, as such definitive statements are considered to refer to habitual behavior. This is downgraded to ‘sometimes’ if there is other evidence suggesting that the behavior does not qualify as frequent (see the case of the Sua).</li>
<li>Rarely: Participation in hunting occurred one time or rarely. Alternatively, it was based on hearsay, indicating the ethnographers themselves never observed it (suggesting rarity). This was also coded for inferred cases (e.g.&nbsp;authors state that net-hunting involves women, and that net-hunting involves capture of given species, but not explicitly stated that women capture given species). Phrases such as accidental, opportunistic, and chance fell under this coding.</li>
<li>Never: Participation in hunting by women said explicitly to not occur, or that only men hunt.</li>
<li>No evidence: No mention of women hunting, but cannot be definitively excluded. When only small or large game are mentioned, the unmentioned size class is classified as ‘no evidence.’</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Rationale</em>: Our reasons for our codings of women’s small and large game hunting frequency.</p>

<span class="math display">\[

<p>where <span class="math inline">\(x_{ii}\)</span> are the values on the diagonal (i.e., the counts of agreement), and <span class="math inline">\(x_{i.}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_{.i}\)</span> are the sums of row <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and column <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, respectively.

<p>The weighted Bangdiwala statistic <span class="citation" data-cites="Bangdiwala_2013">(<a href="#ref-Bangdiwala_2013" role="doc-biblioref">Bangdiwala and Shankar 2013</a>)</span> for rater 2 agreement for small game was B = 0.73, and for rater3 was B = 0.8. The weighted Bangdiwala statistic for rater 2 agreement for large game was B = 0.85, and for rater 3 was B = 0.81. Comparing the independent re-coding of rater 3 with the original re-coding, we identified 10 societies for which there were substantial discrepancies, i.e., a difference of two or more on our ordinal scale (e.g., a coding of “Never” vs.&nbsp;“Sometimes”). These major discrepancies were resolved and the original recode data set updated, which is what we report.</p>
<p>Below are agreement plots for small game and large game for the original ratings (x-axis) vs.&nbsp;rater 2 (y-axis, left) and rater 3 (y-axis, right). The larger outer white rectangles represent the maximum possible agreement for each category, the inner black rectangles represent complete rater agreement, and the gray rectangles represent partial agreement, i.e., adjacent ratings, such as Never vs.&nbsp;Rarely, or Rarely vs.&nbsp;Sometimes.</p>

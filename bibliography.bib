  abstract  = "This book, a comparative study of specialized production in
               prehistoric societies, examines both adaptionist and political
               approaches to specialization and exchange using a worldwide
               perspective. What forms of specialization and exchange promote
               social stratification, political integration and institutional
               specialization? Can increases in specialization always be linked
               to improved subsistence strategies or are they more closely
               related to the efforts of political elites to strengthen
               coalitions and establish institutions of control? Are valuables
               as important as subsistence goods in the developmental process?
               These and other questions are examined in the contexts of ten
               prehistoric societies, ranging from the incipient complexity of
               Mississippian chiefdoms through to the more complex systems of
               West Africa, Hawaii and Bronze Age Europe, to the agrarian
               states of Mesopotamia, Mesoamerica, Peru and Yamato Japan. Each
               society is the subject of a separate study by a scholar whose
               own research has provided new insights into the interplay of
               specialization, exchange and social complexity in the region
               studied.",

              by the Orang Jahai of Hulu Perak. Orang Jahai are still hunters
              and gatherers. Rattan collecting has provided them with a main
              source of income which they use to purchase mainly essential
              goods. Rattan collected for commercial purposes are done by Orang
              Jahai with the help of the towkay, who provided them with the
              transportation such as motorboats and food supplies to enable
              them to go deep into the jungle for the rattan product. The
              rattan are then brought to the collecting centre where they are
              collected by the same towkay, who will pay them after all
              expenditures have been deducted. Although this towkay system
              expose the Orang Jahai to exploitation, nevertheless the system
              has enable them to obtain money for buying food and other
              necessities. ABSTRAK Artikel ini cuba membicarakan kegiatan
              mengeluarkan rotan yang dilakukan oleh Orang Jahai yang tinggal
              di Hulu Perak. Orang Jahai merupakan kumpulan Orang Asli yang
              masih hidup berpindah-randah memburu dan mengumpul hasil hutan
              untuk menyara kehidupan mereka. Kegiatan mengeluarkan hasil hutan
              seperti rotan ini telah membolehkan masyarakat ini mendapat wang
              untuk membeli barang-barang yang mereka perlukan. Bahkan bagi
              masyarakat ini rotan merupakan sumber kewangan yang utama. Rotan
              yang dipasarkan secara komersil dikeluarkan oleh Orang Jahai
              melalui pembiayaan taukeh yang menyediakan kemudahan pengangkutan
              seperti motorbot dan alat-alat lain serta bekalan makanan untuk
              membolehkan mereka pergi ke kawasan pendalaman hutan mencari
              bahan tersebut. Rotan yang telah dipotong ini kemudiannya dibawa
              ke pusat pengumpulan dan taukeh yang membiayai kegiatan ini akan
              datang mengambilnya. Mereka akan hanya dibayar setelah semua kos
              perbelanjaan ditolak daripada hasil jualan rotan tersebut.
              Walaupun sistem bertaukeh ini mendedahkan Orang Jahai kepada
              penindasan tetapi sistem ini telah membolehkan masyarakat ini
              mendapat wang untuk membeli makanan dan keperluan-keperluan lain.",

              A and Schoeninger, Margaret J and Marlowe, Frank W",
  abstract = "The longstanding view that children among foraging populations
              are largely dependent on the food collection efforts of others is
              an assumed and implicit characteristic of several models of human
              life history and family formation. The evolution of protracted
              juvenility in humans is often explained using the ``embodied
              capital model'' which argues that prolonged investment in growth
              and delayed reproduction evolved because a long training period
              is required to learn difficult foraging tasks and become a
              self-sufficient forager. The model suggests that if juvenile
              investment in growth and learning yields an increase in adult
              productivity, then selection will favor delayed maturity, long
              life span, and increased brain size. Here, we test the embodied
              capital model with naturalistic foraging and consumption data
              among juvenile Hadza hunter--gatherers of Tanzania to determine
              the extent to which children self-provision. We found that sex
              had a significant effect on both the type and the amount of food
              brought back to camp and consumed while out foraging; compared to
              their male counterparts, young female foragers consumed less
              while foraging and returned to camp with more food. A wide
              variation in caloric returns was seen across all foragers in the
              sample. When analyzing only food brought back to camp, age was
              not a significant predictor. When combining the amount of food
              back to camp and the amount consumed while out foraging, however,
              older children consistently collected more food. The data
              presented here suggest that although older children do appear to
              have greater overall foraging success, even very young children
              are capable of collecting a considerable amount of food. Our
              data, although lending support to the embodied capital model,
              suggest that although foraging efficiency increases with age, it
              remains difficult to determine if this efficiency is a byproduct
              of learning, strength, or perhaps individual motivation. In
              addition, our results indicate that juvenile self-provisioning
              may have played a key role in the evolution of food sharing and
              cooperation during hominin evolution.",

              extinctions",
  author   = "Barnosky, Anthony D",
  abstract = "Earth's most recent major extinction episode, the Quaternary
              Megafauna Extinction, claimed two-thirds of mammal genera and
              one-half of species that weighed >44 kg between $\approx$50,000
              and 3,000 years ago. Estimates of megafauna biomass (including
              humans as a megafauna species) for before, during, and after the
              extinction episode suggest that growth of human biomass largely
              matched the loss of non-human megafauna biomass until
              $\approx$12,000 years ago. Then, total megafauna biomass crashed,
              because many non-human megafauna species suddenly disappeared,
              whereas human biomass continued to rise. After the crash, the
              global ecosystem gradually recovered into a new state where
              megafauna biomass was concentrated around one species, humans,
              instead of being distributed across many species. Precrash
              biomass levels were finally reached just before the Industrial
              Revolution began, then skyrocketed above the precrash baseline as
              humans augmented the energy available to the global ecosystem by
              mining fossil fuels. Implications include (i) an increase in
              human biomass (with attendant hunting and other impacts)
              intersected with climate change to cause the Quaternary Megafauna
              Extinction and an ecological threshold event, after which humans
              became dominant in the global ecosystem; (ii) with continued
              growth of human biomass and today's unprecedented global warming,
              only extraordinary and stepped-up conservation efforts will
              prevent a new round of extinctions in most body-size and
              taxonomic spectra; and (iii) a near-future biomass crash that
              will unfavorably impact humans and their domesticates and other
              species is unavoidable unless alternative energy sources are
              developed to replace dwindling supplies of fossil fuels.",

  abstract  = "The traditional anthropological view of man as the sole hunter
               is being questioned today and women's role in hunting is being
               highlighted. The evidence from India supports the view of women
               as hunters, no matter how restricted this role may be. The
               archaeological evidence shows that hunting involved women-men
               partnerships. Folklore and puranic myths represent mother
               goddesses as killers of major wild animals. There are many
               historical examples of queens shooting tigers and panthers. In
               the colonial period when shooting a tiger became a status
               symbol, there were sportswomen, both Indian and British, who
               shot major mammals. Also, women from rural and indigenous
               communities, with their simple instruments and techniques,
               killed major mammals to save life and property. A unique tribal
               hunt that survives as a remnant of women's role as hunters is
               known as jani shikar, held every 12 years by indigenous women
               when they go out to hunt wild animals, mainly minor ones today
               as ideas of conservation seep in. Thus, in spite of general
               reservations about and prohibitions on women, there is still a

              Zeanah, David W",
  abstract = "Mobile hunter-gatherers are often characterized as living in
              small communities where mobility and group size are products of
              the environmentally determined distribution of resources, and
              where social organization is multi-scalar: groups of co-residents
              are nested within small communities that are, in turn, nested
              within small-scale societies. Such organization is often assumed
              to be reflective of the human past, emerging as human cognition
              and communication evolved through earlier fission-fusion social
              processes, typical of many primate social systems. We review the
              history of this assumption in light of recent empirical data of
              co-residence and social networks among contemporary
              hunter-gatherers. We suggest that while residential and foraging
              groups are often small, there is little evidence that these
              groups are drawn from small communities nested within small-scale
              societies. Most mobile hunter-gatherers live in groups dominated
              by links between non-relatives, where residential group
              membership is fluid and supports large-scale social networks of
              interaction. We investigate these dynamics with fine-grained
              observational data on Martu foraging groups and social
              organization in Australia's Western Desert. The composition of
              Martu foraging groups is distinct from that of residential
              groups, although both are dominated by ties between individuals
              who have no close biological relationships. The number of
              individuals in a foraging group varies with habitat quality, but
              in a dynamic way, as group size is shaped by ecological legacies
              of land use. The flexible size and composition of foraging groups
              link individuals across their ``estates'': spatially explicit
              storehouses of ritual and relational wealth, inherited across
              generations through maintaining expansive networks of social
              interaction in a large and complex society. We propose that human
              cognition is tied to development of such expansive social
              relationships and co-evolved with dynamic socio-ecological
              interactions expressed in large-scale networks of relational

              people. Traditional Tsimane' bow hunting was strongly affected by
              the introduction of firearms over 30 years ago. Tsimane' of
              Bolivia maintain traditional hunting techniques with bows and
              arrows, sometimes in conjunction with modern firearms. This study
              explores Tsimane' perceived costs and benefits of bow- versus

              factors typical in ecological comparisons of traditional and

              firearms; though multiple studies show reduced game populations

               role in their economy. This general idea was also supported by
               the lack of archaeobotanical studies. Nevertheless, recent
               research at historic Selknam and Yamana sites, and the analysis
               of linguistic and ethnographic data, has shed new light on the
               role of plants among Fuegian populations.Even so, the Fuegian
               hunter-gatherers may be somewhat different to other groupsliving
               in comparable latitudes. The reason is the low plant diversity,
               which comprises only 417 native species. Moreover, geographical
               and seasonal constraints related to the species growing in the
               region, also conditioned the exploitation of plant
               resources.Plants however, had their particular role within the
               framework of the Fuegian economy: they were a constant source of
               raw materials, as well as a valuable source of food, which
               complemented the other dietary resources including meat and
               seafood.This chapter focuses on the relationship of those groups
               with the plant resources available in their region. Ethnographic
               and archaeological data will be combined in order to provide a
               better understanding of plant consumption and its role within

              evidence suggests that it appeared after the emergence of Homo

              develop a mathematical model to investigate under what conditions

              its lifetime into learning and using each skill. We show that

              learning is important for acquiring resources, and there is food
              sharing within a group. We also investigate division of labor by

              important properties also seen in modernized social networks,
              including a skewed degree distribution, degree assortativity,
              transitivity, reciprocity, geographic decay and homophily. We
              demonstrate that Hadza camps exhibit high between-group and low
              within-group variation in public goods game donations. Network
              ties are also more likely between people who give the same
              amount, and the similarity in cooperative behaviour extends up to
              two degrees of separation. Social distance appears to be as
              important as genetic relatedness and physical proximity in

              men, of necessity, provision wives and offspring with hunted
              meat. This theory explains little about the division of labor
              among the Australian Martu, where women hunt extensively and
              gendered asymmetry in foraging decisions is linked to men's and
              women's different social strategies. Women hunt primarily small,
              predictable game (lizards) to provision small kin networks, to
              feed children, and to maintain their cooperative relationships
              with other women. They trade off large harvests against greater
              certainty. Men hunt as a political strategy, using a form of
              ``competitive magnanimity'' to rise in the ritual hierarchy and
              demonstrate their capacity to keep sacred knowledge. Resources

  abstract = "Cooperative hunting is often assumed to be mutualistic,
              maintained through returns to scale, where, by working together,
              foragers can gain higher per capita return rates or harvest sizes
              than they can by hunting alone. We test this hypothesis among
              Martu hunters and find that cooperation only provides increased
              returns to poorer hunters while disadvantaging better hunters.
              Even so, better hunters still cooperate as frequently as poorer
              hunters. We ask whether better hunters are advantaged in
              secondary sharing distributions or whether they bias their
              partner choice to kin or household members. We find that better
              hunters are not more likely to pair up with kin and they do not
              gain consumption benefits from acquiring more. They share a
              greater proportion of their harvest than poorer hunters: no
              matter how much one produces --- better hunter, worse hunter,
              cooperator, solitary hunter --- all eat the same amount in the
              end. Such a result suggests the hypothesis that cooperation might
              be a costly signal of commitment to the public interest on the
              part of better hunters, which generates trust among camp members
              and facilitates strong social networks, particularly among women,

              statistical structure of 1189 social groups in 339
              hunter-gatherer societies from a published compilation of
              ethnographies. We show that population structure is indeed

              groups belonging to each successively higher level of
              organization exhibiting a constant ratio close to 4. Further,

               sharing fish at Warraber Island (Torres Strait) can be
               understood as a form of moral transaction. Gift‐fish are shown
               to be `socially entangled', a fundamental mode of expressing kin
               relatedness as well as providing an indication of the current
               state of such relations. Fish distribution is portrayed locally
               as both an instance of generosity and of obligation,
               demonstrating a person's desire to engage in socially valued
               behaviour or correct their past failings. Importantly, I suggest
               that fish‐giving (and receiving) has a distinctly generational

               hypothesize that the value of women's labor devoted to different

               meat, will determine whether women participate in hunts. Field
               observations were conducted in four different areas: two
               exploited by archers and two by net hunters. Results indicate
               that women in net-hunting areas earn more calories per unit time

               women in archer areas earn more calories by working for

  abstract  = "Despite sharing a recent common ancestor, humans are
               surprisingly different from other great apes. The most obvious
               discontinuities are related to our cognitive abilities,
               including language, but we also have a markedly different,
               cooperative breeding system. Among many nonhuman primates and
               mammals in general, cooperative breeding is accompanied by
               psychological changes leading to greater prosociality, which
               directly enhances performance in social cognition. Here we
               propose that these cognitive consequences of cooperative
               breeding could have become more pervasive in the human lineage
               because the psychological changes were added to an ape-level
               cognitive system capable of understanding simple mental states,
               albeit mainly in competitive contexts. Once more prosocial
               motivations were added, these cognitive abilities could also be
               used for cooperative purposes, including a willingness to share
               mental states, thereby enabling the emergence of shared
               intentionality. Shared intentionality has been identified as the
               original source of many uniquely human cognitive abilities,
               including cumulative culture and language. Shared intentionality
               rests on a fundamentally prosocial disposition that is
               strikingly absent in chimpanzees, but present in cooperatively
               breeding primates. Thus, our hypothesis is that while
               chimpanzees and perhaps all great apes exhibit many of the
               important cognitive preconditions for uniquely human mental
               capacities to evolve, they lack the psychological preconditions.
               In humans, we argue, the two components merged, the cognitive
               component due to common descent from ape ancestors and the
               motivational component due to convergent evolution of traits
               typical of many cooperative breeders.",

               biological differences between females and males, the potential
               physiological advantages females may possess are less well‐known
               and less well‐studied. Here we review and present emerging
               physiological evidence that females may be metabolically better
               suited for endurance activities such as running, which could
               have profound implications for understanding subsistence
               capabilities and patterns in the past. We discuss the role of
               estrogen and adiponectin as respective key modulators of glucose
               and fat metabolism, both of which are critical fuels during long

               increased endurance capacities. Highlighting these potential

               hegemonic masculinity and decries feminism. In a reflexive
               thematic analysis of 227 posts (389,189 words) from two
               manosphere message boards (The Red Pill and Incel), we analyzed
               how posters viewed women and men. We found that beliefs about
               women and men formed an ideology comprised of (a)
               evolution‐based views of gender essentialism, (b) an informal
               psychology of women's motivations, and (c) a typology of men.
               Women were seen as having three primary motives: to deceive and
               manipulate men, to promiscuously satisfy their own sexual needs,
               and to trade sex for power. Men were seen as falling into two
               (The Red Pill) or three (Incel) types: alpha men who are
               attractive, powerful, and sexually successful, beta men who give
               to women as their only route to sexual interactions, and incel
               (involuntarily celibate) men who are too unattractive to achieve
               sexual success. Posters acted on these beliefs either to improve

  author   = "Lupo, Karen D",
  abstract = "The establishment of early human-canid partnerships involving the
              use of dogs in hauling and/or hunting is often nominated as a
              process that underwrote technological, economic and demographic
              changes in prehistoric human populations. Inferences about the
              uses of prehistoric canids are bolstered by reference to
              ethnographic analogues. Archeologists, however, lack an
              inferential framework encompassing a systematic analysis of the
              ethnographic record that identifies the circumstances that
              support and constrain the use of canids. This paper presents
              comparative analyses of hunter-gatherer ethnographic records that
              show the importance of provisioning in supporting dogs engaged in
              energetically demanding activities. Canid thermoregulation in
              concert with work load intensity require significant investments
              provisioning dogs that can greatly inflate the subsistence
              efforts of hunter-gatherers. These data suggest that
              anthropogenic food refuse could not have established or supported
              an indigenous working dog population. Prehistoric human-dog
              interactions in colder biomes that involved the use of dogs
              working in haulage and/or hunting could only be supported after
              intentional provisioning regimes emerged and were incorporated
              into hunter-gatherer subsistence systems. The importance of human
              provisioning in the use of working dogs has implications for
              understanding the circumstances that supported the formation of
              early human-canid working relationships and the domestication

               Islanders (Meriam). Women's fishing had lower failure rates,

               fishing. Men and women responded to trade-offs between mean and

               These results support previous work implicating variance and
               sharing frequency as important resource currencies shaping

               question men's foraging goals. Women tend to target reliable

               to advertise their phenotypic quality to potential mates and
               allies via a costly, and thus hard to fake, signal. An analysis
               of variation in sex-specific foraging was conducted to
               investigate its causes and origins. There is less division of
               labor in less seasonal, more productive habitats where males do
               more gathering. This suggests males respond more as optimal
               foragers than maximal signalers. The division of labor likely
               evolved after pair bonds, and after gathering technology became
               efficient enough to provision others, allowing males to

              associated with being a preferred partner (i.e., campmate) in
              Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania in 2016 and 2019. A total of

              generosity, foraging ability, and their preference for them as
              future campmates. In 2016, Hadza preferred more generous people
              and better hunters as campmates, with evidence suggesting a
              stronger preference for better hunters; however, the relationship

              suggesting that the Hadza do not prefer more cooperative
              campmates. Further, in 2019, there was anecdotal evidence that
              Hadza with greater exposure to outside cultural institutions
              (e.g., schooling, having a job, or living in a village) had a

              and 2009 to examine hypotheses about the causes and consequences
              of men's foraging and food sharing. We find that Hadza men
              foraged for a range of food types, including fruit, honey, small
              animals, and large game. Large game were shared not like common
              goods, but in ways that significantly advantaged producers'
              households. Food sharing and consumption data show that men
              channeled the foods they produced to their wives, children, and
              their consanguineal and affinal kin living in other households.
              On average, single men brought food to camp on 28\% of days,
              married men without children at home on 31\% of days, and married
              men with children at home on 42\% of days. Married men brought
              fruit, the least widely shared resource, to camp significantly
              more often than single men. A model of the relationship between
              hunting success and household food consumption indicates that the
              best hunters provided 3-4 times the amount of food to their
              families than median or poor hunters. These new data fill
              important gaps in our knowledge of the subsistence economy of the
              Hadza and uphold predictions derived from the household and kin
              provisioning hypotheses. Key evidence and assumptions backing
              prior claims that Hadza hunting is largely a form of status
              competition were not replicated in our study. In light of this,
              family provisioning is a more viable explanation for why good

              others.",

              at all levels of biological organization in both animals and
              plants. Well-known examples include the evolution of specialized
              enzymes after gene duplication, the evolution of specialized cell
              types, limb diversification in arthropods, and the evolution of
              specialized colony members in many taxa of marine invertebrates
              and social insects. Here, we identify conditions favoring the
              evolution of division of labor by means of a general mathematical
              model. Our starting point is the assumption that modules
              contribute to two different biological tasks and that the
              potential of modules to contribute to these tasks is traded off.
              Our results are phrased in terms of properties of performance
              functions that map the phenotype of modules to measures of
              performance. We show that division of labor is favored by three
              factors: positional effects that predispose modules for one of
              the tasks, accelerating performance functions, and synergistic
              interactions between modules. If modules can be lost or damaged,
              selection for robustness can counteract selection for functional
              specialization. To illustrate our theory we apply it to the

              these groupings serve to facilitate inter-sexual provisioning,
              kin provisioning, and risk reduction reciprocity, three levels of
              cooperation argued to be fundamental in human societies [7, 8].
              Humans have a suite of derived life history characteristics
              including a long childhood and short inter-birth intervals that
              make offspring energetically demanding [9] and have moved to a
              dietary niche that often involves the exploitation of difficult
              to acquire foods with highly variable return rates [10-12]. This
              means that human foragers face both day-to-day and more long-term
              energetic deficits that conspire to make humans energetically
              interdependent. We suggest that a multilevel social organization
              allows individuals access to both the food sharing partners
              required to buffer themselves against energetic shortfalls and
              the cooperative partners required for skill-based tasks such as
              cooperative foraging.",

               diversity, and downplays attempts to model the original foraging
               lifeway or to use foragers to depict human nature stripped to

              direct measures of human and ape metabolism are needed to compare
              evolved energy strategies among hominoids. Here we used doubly

              kcal day(-1)) in humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and
              orangutans to test the hypothesis that the human lineage has
              experienced an acceleration in metabolic rate, providing energy
              for larger brains and faster reproduction without sacrificing
              maintenance and longevity. In multivariate regressions including

              emergence of modern humans and varies considerably in today's
              traditional societies. Despite these changes and cross-cultural
              differences, the human diet can be characterized by several
              common elements. These include diverse, high quality foods,
              technological complexity to acquire and process food, and the
              establishment of home bases for storage, processing and
              consumption. Together these aspects of the human diet challenge
              any one individual to independently meet all of his or her daily
              caloric needs. Humans solve this challenge through food sharing,
              labor exchange and the division of labor. The cooperative nature
              of the human diet is associated with many downstream effects on
              our life history and physiology. This paper overviews the

              effects on human life history and physiology. Two detailed

              D-PLACE, the Database of Places, Language, Culture, and
              Environment. This expandable and open-access database (accessible
              at https://d-place.org) brings together a dispersed corpus of
              information on the geography, language, culture, and environment
              of over 1400 human societies. We aim to enable researchers to
              investigate the extent to which patterns in cultural diversity
              are shaped by different forces, including shared history,
              demographics, migration/diffusion, cultural innovations, and
              environmental and ecological conditions. We detail how D-PLACE
              helps to overcome four common barriers to understanding these
              forces: i) location of relevant cultural data, (ii) linking data
              from distinct sources using diverse ethnonyms, (iii) variable
              time and place foci for data, and (iv) spatial and historical
              dependencies among cultural groups that present challenges for
              analysis. D-PLACE facilitates the visualisation of relationships
              among cultural groups and between people and their environments,
              with results downloadable as tables, on a map, or on a linguistic
              tree. We also describe how D-PLACE can be used for exploratory,
              predictive, and evolutionary analyses of cultural diversity by a
              range of users, from members of the worldwide public interested
              in contrasting their own cultural practices with those of other
              societies, to researchers using large-scale computational
              phylogenetic analyses to study cultural evolution. In summary, we
              hope that D-PLACE will enable new lines of investigation into the

              expeditions by BaYaka women in the Republic of Congo, we
              investigated how potential support from carers increased mothers'

               diversity of environments humans inhabit, children's activities
               should also reflect local social and ecological opportunities
               and constraints. To better understand our species' developmental
               plasticity, the present paper compiled a time allocation dataset
               for children and adolescents from twelve hunter-gatherer and
               mixed-subsistence forager societies (n = 690; 3--18 years; 52\%
               girls). We investigated how environmental factors, local
               ecological risk, and men and women's relative energetic
               contributions were associated with cross-cultural variation in
               child and adolescent time allocation to childcare, food
               production, domestic work, and play. Annual precipitation,
               annual mean temperature, and net primary productivity were not
               strongly associated with child and adolescent activity budgets.
               Increased risk of encounters with dangerous animals and
               dehydration negatively predicted time allocation to childcare
               and domestic work, but not food production. Gender differences
               in child and adolescent activity budgets were stronger in
               societies where men made greater direct contributions to food
               production than women. We interpret these findings as suggesting
               that children and their caregivers adjust their activities to
               facilitate the early acquisition of knowledge which helps
               children safely cooperate with adults in a range of social and

              [1, 2]. It has been argued that hunter-gatherer's complex social
              structure [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] has facilitated the evolution of
              cumulative culture by allowing information exchange among large
              pools of individuals [10, 11, 12, 13]. However, empirical
              evidence for the interaction between social structure and
              cultural transmission is scant [14]. Here we examine the reported
              co-occurrence of plant uses between individuals in dyads (which
              we define as their ``shared knowledge'' of plant uses) in BaYaka
              Pygmies from Congo. We studied reported uses of 33 plants of 219
              individuals from four camps. We show that (1) plant uses by
              BaYaka fall into three main domains: medicinal, foraging, and
              social norms/beliefs; (2) most medicinal plants have known
              bioactive properties, and some are positively associated with
              children's BMI, suggesting that their use is adaptive; (3)
              knowledge of medicinal plants is mainly shared between spouses
              and biological and affinal kin; and (4) knowledge of plant uses
              associated with foraging and social norms is shared more widely
              among campmates, regardless of relatedness, and is important for
              camp-wide activities that require cooperation. Our results show
              the interdependence between social structure and knowledge
              sharing. We propose that long-term pair bonds, affinal kin
              recognition, exogamy, and multi-locality create ties between
              unrelated families, facilitating the transmission of medicinal
              knowledge and its fitness implications. Additionally,
              multi-family camps with low inter-relatedness between camp
              members provide a framework for the exchange of functional
              information related to cooperative activities beyond the family

              using the Human Relations Area Files and other selected sources.
              Based on life history theory and behavioral ecology, we predicted
              that women should engage in hunting when: i) it poses few
              conflicts with childcare, ii) it is associated with few cultural
              restrictions around the use of hunting technology, iii) it
              involves low-risk game within range of camp, with the aid of
              dogs, and/or in groups, and, iv) women fulfill key logistical or
              informational roles. We systematically reviewed ethnographic
              documents across 64 societies and coded 242 paragraphs for the
              above variables. The data largely support theoretical
              expectations. When women hunted, they did so in a fundamentally
              different manner than men, focusing on smaller game and hunting
              in large groups near camp, often with the aid of dogs. There was
              little evidence to suggest that women only participated in
              hunting during non-reproductive years; instead, allocate networks
              were a prominent strategy for mitigating tradeoffs between
              hunting and childcare responsibilities. Women commonly fulfilled
              crucial informational, logistical, and ritualistic roles.
              Cultural restrictions limited women's participation in hunting,

               construction as an evolutionary process, and uses of niche
               construction to refer to a kind of human behavior. Formal models
               from NCT examine how environmental modification can change the
               selection pressures that organisms face. In contrast, formal
               models from HBE predict behavior assuming people behave

               when and why people engage in niche construction. We emphasize

              other great apes. How do human subsistence strategies accommodate
              our expanded energy budgets? We found that relative to other
              great apes, human hunter-gatherers and subsistence farmers spend
              more energy but less time on subsistence, acquire substantially
              more energy per hour, and achieve similar energy efficiencies.
              These findings revise our understanding of human energetic
              evolution by indicating that humans afford expanded energy
              budgets primarily by increasing rates of energy acquisition, not
              through energy-saving adaptations such as economical bipedalism
              or sophisticated tool use that decrease subsistence costs and
              improve the energetic efficiency of subsistence. We argue that
              the time saved by human subsistence strategies provides more

               hunter-gatherer spatial behaviour on a very large scale, using
               GPS devices worn by Hadza foragers to record 2,078 person-days
               of movement. Theory in movement ecology suggests that the
               density and mobility of targeted foods should predict spatial
               behaviour and that strong gender differences should arise in a
               hunter-gatherer context. As predicted, we find that men walked
               further per day, explored more land, followed more sinuous paths
               and were more likely to be alone. These data are consistent with
               the ecology of male- and female-targeted foods and suggest that
               male landscape use is more navigationally challenging in this
               hunter-gatherer context. Comparisons of Hadza space use with
               space use data available for non-human primates suggest that the

               of labor, often described as ``Man the Hunter and Woman the
               Gatherer,'' continues to dominate the literature. We see it used
               as the default hypothesis in anatomical and physiological
               reconstructions of the past as well as studies of modern people
               evoking evolutionary explanations. However, the idea of a strict
               sexual labor division in the Paleolithic is an assumption with
               little supporting evidence, which reflects a failure to question
               how modern gender roles color our reconstructions of the past.
               Here we present examples to support women's roles as hunters in
               the past as well as challenge oft‐cited interpretations of the
               material culture. Such evidence includes stone tool function,
               diet, art, anatomy and paleopathology, and burials. By pulling

               with the modern human physiology presented in the accompanying
               paper (Ocobock and Lacy, this issue), we argue that not only are
               women well‐suited to endurance activities like hunting, but
               there is little evidence to support that they were not hunting
               in the Paleolithic. Going forward, paleoanthropology should

              the development of foraging proficiency have focused on assessing
              this hypothesis, yet studies present inconsistent conclusions
              regarding the connection between foraging skill development and
              niche complexity. Here, we leverage published records of child
              and adolescent foragers from 28 societies to (i) quantify how
              skill-intensive different resources are and (ii) assess whether

              important influence on men's and women's foraging decisions.
              However, the provisioning of other adults may be equally
              important in determining gender differences in resource choice,
              particularly when the goals of provisioning offspring versus
              others cannot be met with the acquisition of the same resources.
              Here, we examine how resources vary in their expected daily
              energetic returns and in the variance or risk around those
              returns. We predict that when available resources impose no
              trade-off between risk and energy, the targets of men's and
              women's foraging will converge on high-energy, low-risk resources
              that allow for the simultaneous provisioning of offspring and
              others. However, when minimizing risk and maximizing energy
              trade-off with one another, we expect men's foraging to focus on
              provisioning others through the unreliable acquisition of large
              harvests, while women focus on reliably acquiring smaller
              harvests to feed offspring. We test these predictions with
              foraging data from three populations (Ach{\'e}, Martu and
              Meriam). The results uphold the predictions, suggesting that
              men's and women's foraging interests converge when high-energy
              resources can be reliably acquired, but diverge when
              higher-energy resources are associated with higher levels of

              seemingly coincided with the arrival of people in the Americas,
              their extinction is often attributed to human overkill,
              notwithstanding a dearth of archaeological evidence of human
              predation. Moreover, this period saw the extinction of other
              species, along with significant changes in many surviving taxa,
              suggesting a broader cause, notably, the ecological upheaval that
              occurred as Earth shifted from a glacial to an interglacial
              climate. But, overkill advocates ask, if extinctions were due to
              climate changes, why did these large mammals survive previous
              glacial−interglacial transitions, only to vanish at the one when
              human hunters were present? This question rests on two
              assumptions: that previous glacial−interglacial transitions were
              similar to the end of the Pleistocene, and that the large mammal
              genera survived unchanged over multiple such cycles. Neither is
              demonstrably correct. Resolving the cause of large mammal

              at the Pleistocene−Holocene boundary that might have led to those

               provide reproductive benefits to the hunter challenges the
               traditional view that men hunt to provision their families. Two
               broad assumptions underlie the signaling view: (1) hunting is a
               poor means of obtaining food, and (2) hunted game is a public
               good shared widely with others and without expectation of future

               METHODS: Behavioral data were derived from ~15 000 hourly
               in-camp scan observations of 76 individuals and 13 out-of-camp
               focal follows on nine individuals. The data were used to

               spend more time engaged in work-related and economic activities

               activities out of camp; and (3) foraging by both sexes tends to
               net caloric gains despite being energetically costly.
               CONCLUSIONS: These results show that, among the Hadza, a sexual
               division of labor begins to emerge in middle childhood and is
               well in place by adolescence. Furthermore, foraging tends to
               provide net caloric gains, suggesting that children are capable
               of reducing at least some of the energetic burden they place
               upon their parents or alloparents. The findings are relevant to
               our understanding of the ways in which young foragers allocate
               their time, the development of sex-specific behavior patterns,
               and the capacity of children's work efforts to offset the cost
               of their own care in a cooperative breeding environment.",

  abstract  = "One of the pathways by which the scientific community confirms
               the validity of a new scientific discovery is by repeating the
               research that produced it. When a scientific effort fails to
               independently confirm the computations or results of a previous
               study, some fear that it may be a symptom of a lack of rigor in
               science, while others argue that such an observed inconsistency
               can be an important precursor to new discovery. Concerns about
               reproducibility and replicability have been expressed in both
               scientific and popular media. As these concerns came to light,
               Congress requested that the National Academies of Sciences,
               Engineering, and Medicine conduct a study to assess the extent
               of issues related to reproducibility and replicability and to
               offer recommendations for improving rigor and transparency in
               scientific research. Reproducibility and Replicability in
               Science defines reproducibility and replicability and examines
               the factors that may lead to non-reproducibility and
               non-replicability in research. Unlike the typical expectation of
               reproducibility between two computations, expectations about
               replicability are more nuanced, and in some cases a lack of
               replicability can aid the process of scientific discovery. This
               report provides recommendations to researchers, academic
               institutions, journals, and funders on steps they can take to
               improve reproducibility and replicability in science.",

  abstract = "This article focuses on the division of labor between evolution
              and development in solving sequential, state-dependent decision
              problems. Currently, behavioral ecologists tend to use dynamic
              programming methods to study such problems. These methods are
              successful at predicting animal behavior in a variety of
              contexts. However, they depend on a distinct set of assumptions.
              Here, we argue that behavioral ecology will benefit from drawing
              more than it currently does on a complementary collection of
              tools, called reinforcement learning methods. These methods allow
              for the study of behavior in highly complex environments, which
              conventional dynamic programming methods do not feasibly address.
              In addition, reinforcement learning methods are well-suited to
              studying how biological mechanisms solve developmental and
              learning problems. For instance, we can use them to study simple
              rules that perform well in complex environments. Or to
              investigate under what conditions natural selection favors fixed,
              non-plastic traits (which do not vary across individuals),
              cue-driven-switch plasticity (innate instructions for adaptive
              behavioral development based on experience), or developmental
              selection (the incremental acquisition of adaptive behavior based
              on experience). If natural selection favors developmental
              selection, which includes learning from environmental feedback,
              we can also make predictions about the design of reward systems.
              Our paper is written in an accessible manner and for a broad
              audience, though we believe some novel insights can be drawn from

              of wild animals, and represents a ``war waged by humanity against
              the wilderness'' (1933: 30). In a similar fashion Marilyn French
              has suggested that the advent of hunting marked a profound change
              in human's relationship with nature, and was implicated in the
              emergence of 'patriarchy' ? it heralded the 'fall' from an early
              state where humans were peaceful, gentle and humorous folk
              (1986:17). Symbolic anthropologists have been equally negative
              towards hunting, and in gnostic fashion, have portrayed it as the
              antithesis of life-giving procreation and sexuality. Hunting has,
              indeed, had a very bad press, particularly from feminists
              scholars. I want in this paper to counter this negative portrait,
              both by offering some reflection on this literature and by
              briefly examining the ritual aspects of hunting in Malawi. The
              paper thus has two sections. In the first part, I discuss hunting
              with special reference to hunter-gatherers; and in the second I
              focus on the communal hunt in Malawi and on its ritual aspects ?
              aiming to counter the suggestion that hunting is always perceived

               returns from individual specialisation are required to favour
               the evolution of division of labour. Yanni et al., 2020, showed
               that topologically constrained groups, where cells cooperate
               with only direct neighbours such as for filaments or branching
               growths, can evolve a reproductive division of labour even with
               diminishing returns from individual specialisation. We develop a
               conceptual framework and specific models to investigate the
               factors that can favour the initial evolution of reproductive
               division of labour. We find that selection for division of
               labour in topologically constrained groups: (1) is not a single
               mechanism to favour division of labour---depending upon details
               of the group structure, division of labour can be favoured for
               different reasons; (2) always involves an efficiency benefit at
               the level of group fitness; and (3) requires a mechanism of
               coordination to determine which individuals perform which tasks.
               Given that such coordination must evolve prior to or
               concurrently with division of labour, this could limit the
               extent to which topological constraints favoured the initial
               evolution of division of labour. We conclude by suggesting
               experimental designs that could determine why division of labour

              life-history theory seeks to explain cross-species differences in
              these variables and the covariation between them. That provides
              the foundation for a hypothesis that a novel role for
              grandmothers underlies the shift from an ape-like ancestral
              pattern to one more like our own in the first widely successful
              members of genus Homo. This hypothesis links four distinctive
              features of human life histories: 1). our potential longevity,
              2). our late maturity, 3). our midlife menopause, and 4). our

              declines persisted in our genus, while 2). senescence in other
